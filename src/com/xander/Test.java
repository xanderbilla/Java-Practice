/*
* - Generic introduced in Java 5.0
* - Generic is used with ArrayList, HashMap, HashSet, etc.
* - Three main advantages of using Generics are:
*       + Type Safety: We can hold only a single type of objects in generics. It doesnâ€™t allow to store other objects.
*       + Type Casting is not required: There is no need to typecast the object.
*       + Compile-Time Checking: It is checked at compile time so the problem will not occur at runtime.
